Final capstone project for Electrical and Computer Engineering majors at OSU. Involves computer vision and networking with microcontrollers. The objective was to create a device for automobiles that reduces accidents caused by distracted driving. This was accomplished by integrating hardware and software together to create an intelligent system capable of detecting the presence of stoplights in advance of a driver entering an intersection. The software in the system is written in in Python, and utilizes several packages to create pipelines for data processing, and object recognition, such as OpenCV, GRIP, and NumPy. At a high level, the program reads each frame from a live video stream and checks whether a red stoplight is present by creating a 'frame object' and passing it into an object-recognition algorithm. It recives input by networking with the onboard diagnostics system (car computer), which provides data about the instantanious speed of the car. The program sends a noise to a speaker if the algorithm detects a red light, and the car's speed is greater than zero.  The most important hardware components involved in the system are the microcontroller (Raspberry Pi), which runs the Python code, a camera, an OBD-connector (for streaming the speed data), and a speaker for the output. In addition, there are nine other hardware components, which are used for various connections and troubleshooting operations. The source code and final project report are found in this repository.
